phantomjsBots
=============

This is a rep of my phantomjs bots. I would be sad loosing them so...

1 - **friendsUrlFB.js** : this one is for returning a txt of your friends name and their profiles url from facebook.

*usage : phantomjs --ssl-protocol=any friendsUrlFB.js facebookLogin facebookPass*

It will save on a txt named 'namesUrl.txt' at the same dir the result.

2 - **getEmailsFB.js** : this bot visits all your friends and if they have emails available for you it will get and save on a txt file called 'mails.txt'.

*usage : phantomjs --ssl-protocol=any getEmailsFB.js facebookLogin facebookPass*

**ADVICE**

> Its not 100% functional,  
> At the moment its somewhat slow,  
> If you use it a lot of times facebook will ban you from seeing all your friends emails  
> If no email available the txt will print # or - when you should see the email
