phantomjsBots
=============

This is a rep of my phantomjs bots. I would be sad loosing them so...

1 - friendsUrlFB.js : this one is for returning a txt of your friends name and their profiles url from facebook.

usage : phantomjs --ssl-protocol=any friendsUrlFB.js facebookLogin facebookPass

It will save on a txt named 'namesUrl.txt' at the same dir the result.
